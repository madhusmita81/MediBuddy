# Mediassist
Mediassist serves as a repository for a medical chatbot incorporating the Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML model and content from the PDF version of The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine. While the chatbot is currently in the developmental stage, it holds promise as a valuable tool for patients, healthcare professionals, and researchers. Its functionalities include answering queries on medical subjects, offering summaries of medical articles, and generating medical text. It is crucial to emphasize, however, that the chatbot is not a replacement for medical advice provided by a qualified healthcare professional.
